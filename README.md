# Modelica-Grasshopper
This respository contains Grasshopper components that use python libraries for modelica.

## Used tools, libraries and plugins
[Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download), [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/), [OpenModelica v1.16.0-dev.03 64-bit](https://openmodelica.org/download/download-windows)


Python libraries for modelica: 
[OMPython](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMPython), [OMSimulator](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMSimulator), [PySimulator](https://github.com/PySimulator/PySimulator), [pymoca](https://github.com/pymoca/pymoca), [pyfmu](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/pyfmu), [BuildingsPy](https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy)...

By default Grasshopper in Rhino 6 has GHPython component with IPython 2.7.8 and Rhino 7 (WIP) has IPython 2.7.9.

To use Python 3.x inside Grasshopper additional plugin [GH_CPython](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghcpython) is used.
